## 1. Introduction

Printify Automation ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide

- **API Keys (stored locally):** Printify, Gemini, and OpenAI API keys you enter are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. These keys are sent only to the relevant third-party API providers when you initiate an action (e.g., generate content, create products).
- **Account Information (stored on our server):** If you create an account, we store your email address, password hash, subscription plan/status, and verification/reset metadata (e.g., verification codes or reset tokens).
- **License Information (stored locally + on our server):** If you enter a license key, it is stored locally to unlock features; license validation occurs by sending the license key to our licensing API.

### 2.2 Information We Don't Collect

- ❌ We do NOT collect or store your design images
- ❌ We do NOT track your browsing history
- ❌ We do NOT sell any data to third parties
- ❌ We do NOT use cookies for advertising

### 2.3 Automatically Collected Information

- **Usage Statistics:** Basic usage events/counts (e.g., number of products created) to enforce subscription limits and prevent abuse.
- **Service/Request Metadata:** We may process standard server log data (e.g., request time, IP address, user agent) for security, rate-limiting, troubleshooting, and fraud prevention.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and maintain the extension functionality

### 4.3 Security Measures

- ✅ Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms
- ✅ API keys are stored locally and are not stored on our servers
